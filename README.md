# Unitify
Unitify is a library for converting data, such as temperature, to other units of measurement. An example would be converting 
from Celsius to Kelvin. With this library it will be done automatically.

## What magnitudes does it support?
It supports all basic quantities. Derivatives will be added later.
| Basic quantities | Unit | Unit symbol |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Length | metre | m |
| Mass | kilogram | kg |
| Time | second | s |
| Electric current | ampere | A |
| Thermodynamic temperature | kelvin | K |
| Amount of substance | mole | mol |
| Luminous intensity | candela | cd |

##  Who might find it useful?
The main idea behind Unitify was to save time and simplify work, especially in science-related fields. It can be very useful for data scientists who analyze temperatures or other magnitudes. This way, they won't need to create anything that automates switching between units of measurement, because Unitify has that and more.
